# Movie-List V3 📝
A mobile app that keeps track of anything and everything you plan on watching (or have already seen)

## Motivation 🎯
I used to keep track of movies that I planned on watching via a simple notes app on my phone. If I had just seen an interesting trailer or spoken to a friend who recommended a movie/show, I would simply open the notes app and write down the name of the movie on a new line. Then, when it came time to watch something new on that list, the same lengthy tedious process began. Go through the entire list, try to remember why you had that movie on the list to begin with, what was that movie even about, check who starred in it, check if it had good ratings, search and watch the trailer again, ... etc. 😤 <br><br>
I decided to address this problem by creating Movie-List V3. Users can type in the name of any movie or show and a robust webscraper behind the scenes retrieves key details about that movie/show which are then saved in the list with persistant storage. Lists in the app are separated into 2 so users can keep track of movies they plan on watching as well as ones they have already seen. The app was built from the ground up with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and implements modern touch controls amongst many other features.
